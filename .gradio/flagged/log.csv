It originated in Southeast Asia as a method of preserving raw fish using fermented rice. This early form of sushi, known as narezushi, appeared in Japan around the 8th century. Over time, the process evolved, and during the Edo period in Japan, sushi makers began using rice vinegar to season the rice, creating a quicker and more flavorful dish. This led to the development of modern sushi, which combines vinegared rice with various ingredients, including fish and vegetables. The California Roll is an example of how sushi has continued to evolve, incorporating new flavors and styles.\n\nIn your area, Basa Seafood Express in San Francisco is known for its sushi offerings.
