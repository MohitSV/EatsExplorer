The result from the Tavily search is not relevant to the question, as it only contains the word \""hi\"" and a reference to a file (\""123.txt\"") without any context or information about tomatoes.\n\nTo answer the question independently of the provided results: Botanically, tomatoes are classified as fruits because they develop from the ovary of a flower and contain seeds. However, in culinary terms, tomatoes are often treated as vegetables due to their savory flavor and common use in salads, sauces, and other vegetable dishes. This dual classification is why tomatoes are sometimes referred to as \""culinary vegetables\"" despite being botanical fruits.\n\n\n    tavily_references: ['123.txt']\n\n\n    No database results found\n\n\n    "", ""options"": null}]",2025-02-10 20:16:20.773913
